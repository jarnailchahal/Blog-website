### What are we trying to do for the end-user(s) of the predictive system? What objectives are we serving?


Creating a location-based application that tracks location using the data obtained from a small tacking attached to your kids, pets etc. Parents will be able to view their kidsâ€™ location in real time using our app to protect them from (losing, kidnapping etc.)

Use machine learning to recognize daily location patterns of the kids. Constrict an area on the map (called a *safe zone*) and when the child goes outside that, send an alert to the parent.

**Product:**
Buying GPS watches in bulk - [Alibaba Kids GPS watch](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Q50-Gsm-gps-watch-for-kids_60403041745.html?spm=a2700.icbuShop.41413.30.20f4455boSVmwQ&fullFirstScreen=true&bypass=true)

**Application:**
Making our software application that communicates with the watch GPS, tracks location and generates graphs for the end user.




### Which raw data sources can we use ?


Internal data source: Location data generated by the GPS Watch.

*	Use google location API  to display location in maps page of our application. Location data (Lats/Longs info) comes from the GPS tracker inside the watch.
*	Use [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) to create various graphs from the above data.
